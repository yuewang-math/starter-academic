title: Controllablity of Nodal Profile
summary: The exact boundary controllability of nodal profile for (a coupled system of) linear and quasi-linear wave equations is a new class of exact boundary controllability problems proposed in recent years according to practical application requirements. There are already quite mature processing methods and results. It has both practical application prospects and broadens the research scope of exact boundary controllability of node profile. Challenges have been raised in the theoretical in-depth treatment, and there are many problems to be studied in depth.

**RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:**
Description: |2-
Exact boundary controllability of nodal profile for (a coupled system of) hyperbolic systems:
 * Nonlinear case. Classical solution. Based on the constructive method to design controls. Study on Vibrating strings on network with/without loops, geometrically exact beams, shallow water system. 
 * Linear case. Weak solution. Based on HUM and duality method to establish the relationship between controllability of nodal profile and the corresponding observability problem. Design HUM control.
