Yue Wang got her Bachelor degree (2015) and Doctor degree (2019) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Her PhD was conducted in the research group Analysis and Applied PDEs located at Shanghai Center of Mathematics, and was supervised by Prof. Tatsien Li.  After that, she did the 2-year PostDoc at the Chair of Applied Mathematics II led by Günter Leugering in FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. She is currently working at the Chair of Dynamics, Control and Numerics led by Enrique Zuazua at the Department of Data Science (DDS) and Research Center for Mathematics of Data (MoD) in FAU.  

Her field of expertise is in the area of Control Theory for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), especially nonlinear hyperbolic systems. Her research focuses on control problems on networks and related topics in modeling, analysis, control design, sychronization, and learning.

She said: " I am always loving Mathematics \- it opens a window onto the order of nature hidden - brings me a story of life to understand the world I am in \- and involves me in it emotionally and intellectually. "
