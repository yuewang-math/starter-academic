abstract = "On 06. March 2014 Andreas Joswig asked a provocative question on the Linguistics Discussion List about the qualifications of .mp3 audio formats.  I quote our previous email correspondence here for context, and my final response which I hope is more informative than divisive. There were a lot of in between interactions between various members of the LDL including Ken Olson and J. Albert Bickford. The in between messages really shaped the conversation, and can be looked at through the archives of the LDL (contact the list admin for how to do that). They are not replicated here yet do to length. \n\n The purpose of this blog post is to record my final reply in a broader context than the LDL. There are several different groups in SIL operations who use audio, and there is no real position statement by the SIL Language and Culture Archive on what is the position or best practice of the Audio Archiving Industry, or the Cultural Heritage Archiving industry is with respect to audio formats. There is also no statement from the SIL Linguistics or Language Documentation Domains on the service standards SIL will strive to abide by when their staff is involved in language documentation projects. It is my goal here to provide as much connection to relevant literature as possible. My reply to Andreas will also be sent out on the LDL on or around 20. March 2014. However, the conversation may continue here, in the comments. Some comments may be incorporated into this post (i.e. if relevant literature is cited, that literature might also be incorporated into the relevant discussion section). If comments are sufficiently incorporated then they may be deleted, to keep the page clean. \n\n Perhaps some intense interest here, and some appropriate follow-up action might produce an educational touch point on the SIL public website about Audio formats, and the rationale behind it, so that SIL's position can be made clear to both internal audiences and external audiences."
