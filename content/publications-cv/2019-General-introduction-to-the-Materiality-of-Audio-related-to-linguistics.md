abstract = "Linguist have a unique relationship to audio artifacts. This relationship both drives the production of new audio artifacts and the perception of the usefulness of existing artifacts. While in attendance at the 2019 annual meeting of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, linguistics and language based perspectives on audio were under represented. This led to many cordial discussions over various views on recorded sound. Those discussions and interactions are the inspiration for this article which is positioned as a gentle overview of the various uses of audio within the broad fields of linguistics, language and documentation and the linguistic sciences. I expect that linguistics librarians, special collections librarians (for collection with audio or linguistic and cultural content), audio technicians, and archivists with audio collections will benefit from a general familiarity with the topics discussed.
