abstract = "This thought exercise is based on several conversations about OpenData. In many respects this is the fodder for my 6th ICLDC paper on copyright and the distributed Lexicon. These conversations focus on the question: _What is the role of a language development \"company\" when developing a language? â€” especially with regards to data release, and the fostering of \"online\" and \"digital\" communities around that data._ Contributing the dialog which shaped this thought exercise were Alex Mercado, Oliver Stegen, and the business emphasis on services and service development in SIL International lead by Steve Moitozo and Chip Sanders. While my original writings focus on OpenData as a corporate business model, ideals which push for OpenData are mitigated by four factors: \n\n 1) Data is currency and can be exchanged for two other currencies which are needed to run any company: _Money_, and _Good Will_. \n\n 2) Data needs community to remain relevant. Data without community interaction and curation becomes stale and diminishes in value. \n\n 3) When released as OpenData the organization, which in our case does not want to continue to engage in a data curation role, does not continue to retain engagement with the language development activities around the data. \n\n 4) Online communities which do form around 'OpenData' tend for form editorial oligarchies. What should be the legacy of a language development organization with regards to the fostering of such an oligarchy and in very small language communities is this oligarchy model really healthy for the online and offline language using community?"
