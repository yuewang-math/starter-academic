abstract = "When  conducting  fieldwork  on  tone  languages,  the linguist  choosing  to  use  the  IPA  to  make  phonetic transcriptions  of  tone  is  presented  with  a  challenge: Current  methods  of  tone  transcription  in  the  IPA require a degree of phonological analysis before they can   be   applied   and   when   applied   they   do   not adequately display pitch distinctions relative to other pitches. I describe this challenge and the bar method as  a  proposed  solution.  The  bar  method  visually presents    F0    distinctions    relative    to    other    F0 expressions  without  ties  to  segments.  I  hope  this solution  facilitates  the  discussion  of  phonetic  tone transcription     without     regard     to     phonological assumptions,   linguistic   tradition,   or   geographical area of research."
