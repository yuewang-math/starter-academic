abstract: By equivalently replacing the dynamical boundary condition by a kind of nonlocal boundary conditions, and noting a hidden regularity of solution on the boundary with a dynamical boundary condition, a constructive method with modular structure is used to get the local exact boundary controllability for 1-D quasilinear wave equations with dynamical boundary conditions.
