abstract: By means of an equivalent non-local boundary condition, and noting a hidden regularity of solution on the boundary with end mass, the authors use a constructive method with modular structure to obtain local exact boundary controllability for a coupled system of quasilinear wave equations with dynamical boundary conditions. Some applications are given for the chain-like and star-like system of strings coupled via springs, respectively.
