abstract = {A constructive method with modular structure is used to obtain the local exact boundary controllability for a coupled system of quasilinear wave equations with local or non-local dynamical boundary conditions. Some applications are given for the chain-like or star-like system of strings coupled via elastic springs, and of strings coupled via Maxwell-type and Kelvin-type viscoelastic springs, respectively.}
