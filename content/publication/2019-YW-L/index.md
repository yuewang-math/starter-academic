abstract = "Based on the theory of exact boundary controllability of nodal profile for hyperbolic systems, the authors propose the concept of exact boundary controllability of partial nodal profile to expand the scope of applications. With the new concept, we can shorten the controllability time, save the number of controls, and increase the number of charged nodes with given nodal profies. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of in-situ controlled node to deal with a new situation that one node can be charged and controlled simultaneously. The minimum number of boundary controls on the entire tree-like network is determined by using the concept of 'degree of freedom of charged nodes' introduced. And the concept of 'control path' is introduced to appropriately divide the network, so that we can determine the infimum of controllability time. General frameworks of constructive proof are given on a single interval, a star-like network, a chainlikenetwork and a planar tree-like network for  linear wave equation(s) with Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin and dissipative boundary conditions to establish a complete theory on the exact boundary controllability of partial nodal profile, which can be generalized to the quasilinear case."
