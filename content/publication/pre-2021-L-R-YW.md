abstract: We consider networks of elastic strings with end masses, where the coupling is modeled via elastic springs. The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system tends to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions, as the spring stiffness terms tend to in finity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamical and, consequently, the corresponding first order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We show well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions  and observe extra regularity at the masses.
