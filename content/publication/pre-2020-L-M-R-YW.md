abstract = " In this paper, we study the problem of exact boundary controllability for a coupled system of 1-D linear wave equations with dynamical boundary conditions. By spectral analysis, we translate the original control problem into an equivalent moment problem. For the null controllability by one control at the boundary, we find an asymmetric space of controllable data described in terms of Fourier coefficients. More precisely, we prove that the regularity of the initial data corresponding to the second string should be higher than the one of the first string in order to be controllable from the right extremity of the latter."
