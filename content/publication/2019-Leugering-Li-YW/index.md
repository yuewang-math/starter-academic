abstract: We consider the out-of-the-plane displacements of nonlinear elastic strings which are coupled through point masses attached to the ends and viscoelastic springs. We provide the modeling, the well-posedness in the sense of classical semi-global C2-solutions together with some extra regularity at the masses and then prove exact boundary controllability and velocity-feedback stabilizability, where controls act on both sides of the mass-spring-coupling.
