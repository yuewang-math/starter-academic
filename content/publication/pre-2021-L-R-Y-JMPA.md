abstract = "In this work, we consider networks of so-called geometrically exact beams, namely, shearable beams that may undergo large motions. The corresponding mathematical model, commonly written in terms of displacements and rotations expressed in a fixed basis (GEB model), has a quasilinear governing system. However, the model may also be written in terms of intrinsic variables expressed in a moving basis attached to the beam (IGEB model) and while the number of equations is then doubled, the latter model presents the advantage of being of first-order hyperbolic and only semilinear. First, for any network, we show the existence-uniqueness of semi-global in time classical solutions to the IGEB model (i.e., for any given time interval, provided that the data are small enough). Then, for a specific network containing a cycle, we address the problem of local exact controllability of nodal profiles for the IGEB model we steer the solution to satisfy given profiles at one of the multiple nodes by means of controls applied at the simple nodes. Afterwards, for any network, we show that the existence of a unique classical solution to the IGEB network implies the same for the corresponding GEB network, by using that these two models are related by a nonlinear transformation. In particular, this allows us to give corresponding existence-uniqueness and controllability results for the GEB network."
